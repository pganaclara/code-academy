      <h1>Your Average Recipe: Boiled Eggs!</h1>
      <p>
        Every now and then, I recall back to my travels through the mystical
        lands of Durgemdia. Sometimes, the weather was hot and muggy. Other
        times, it was simply hot. Rarely was it only muggy. It was on one of
        those muggy days I lost my wallet and backpack. Down on my luck and
        money, I decided to leave the city and venture into the jungle to forage
        for food.

        On the second day of my jungle trek, I stumbled upon an abandoned
        chicken farm over run by feral chickens. I thought that if I could catch
        one, I could feast for a day! However, their numbers proved to be too
        much and their pecks too vicious. I curled into a ball and waited for
        the pecking to stop. A few hours later, they relented. These chicken
        took mercy on me and in time accepted me as their own. As I rose up
        through the pecking order, I gained the trust of these chicken.

        It was around that time that I saw an opportunity, I stole as many eggs
        as I could fit in a bag and ran as fast as I could. I was forced to drop
        the bag into a stream and ran until the chickens gave up their chase.
        Afterwards, I traced my steps to the stream and noticed that it was
        steaming! I was so hungry and tired that I cracked opened the first egg
        I saw. Amazingly, the egg was no longer raw!

        Here's the recipe: Take an egg. Put it in hot water. If you're using
        warm water, it'll take longer. Wait 10 - 45 minutes. The wait time
        depends on how long it takes for you to find your eggs again. Crack open
        the eggs and eat!
